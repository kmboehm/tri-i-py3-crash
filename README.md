# tri-i-py3-crash
Changes to make:
1. Interactive coding (prepared in advance in this repo)
2. Test all code in advance
3. Make sure slides are in order
4. Fewer CS-specific terms (e.g. literals) at the start. Build from practical basics to minor intuition
5. Kevin make sure to actually introduce techniques used on the slides :P

Schedule:
Come at 6:45. If you have IDLE, come at 7.
