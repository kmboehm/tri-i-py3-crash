The Ensembl GTF format is a common one for describing genomic annotations 
such as genes, exons, transcripts, etc.

It is described in full detail here: 
https://useast.ensembl.org/info/website/upload/gff.html

But for our purposes, a very brief summary follows:

Each *feature* is described in a single line. Within each
line, white space (spaces or tabs) separate 9 fields. The first field 
gives the name of the chromosome. The 3rd field gives the type of the feature
(e.g. "transcript" or "CDS").

Given the example reduced GTF (drawn from the most recent release 94 of 
the human genome annotation), find only those lines that have feature type 
"CDS" and write those to a new file.

Hint: for a string s, s.split() returns a list of strings that were 
separated by white space in the original string s!
